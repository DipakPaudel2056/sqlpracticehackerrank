-- -- here is the problem statemet ---
-- Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

-- Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
-- Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
-- Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
-- Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
-- Input Format

-- The TRIANGLES table is described as follows:



-- Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

-- Sample Input



-- Sample Output

-- Isosceles
-- Equilateral
-- Scalene
-- Not A Triangle

-- the solution to hackerrank problem typeof triangle is 

 SELECT CASE             
            WHEN A + B > C AND B + C > A AND A + C > B THEN
                CASE 
                    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
                    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
                    ELSE 'Scalene'
                END
            ELSE 'Not A Triangle'
        END
